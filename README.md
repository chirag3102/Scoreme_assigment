## Advanced Graph Coloring with Constraints

# Introduction
This project implements an advanced graph coloring algorithm in Python, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The solution addresses a complex set of constraints, including minimum color usage, pre-assigned colors, color exclusions, dynamic graph changes, and heuristic optimization. The design emphasizes modularity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices in software development.
# Project Structure
The project consists of several key classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the graph coloring problem:
`Graph` Class: Manages the graph structure and operations.
`ColoringSolver` Class: Implements the graph coloring algorithm.
`ConstraintManager` Class: Handles constraints related to coloring.
`HeuristicOptimizer` Class: Applies heuristic techniques to optimize coloring.
Test Suite: Validates the implementation against various scenarios.
