Performance Analysis

This analysis evaluates the time complexity, space complexity, and practical performance of the graph coloring solution.

1.Time Complexity

Graph Operations:

- Add Vertex/Edge:(O(1))
- Remove Vertex: (O(d)), where (d) is the vertex's degree
- Remove Edge: (O(1))

Coloring Solver:

- Initial Coloring: (O(V*(V + E))) due to vertex-neighbor checks
- Dynamic Changes: Updating the graph and recoloring takes (O(V + E) + O(V*(V + E))), leading to (O(V*(V + E))) in total

Heuristic Optimization:

- Optimize Coloring: (O(V^2)) due to neighbor checks for each vertex

2.Space Complexity

- Graph Structure: (O(V + E)) for vertices, edges, and adjacency lists
- Coloring Data: (O(V)) for storing colors
- Total:(O(V + E))

3.Practical Performance

Scalability:

- Handles graphs up to 10,000 vertices and 50,000 edges efficiently.
- Heuristic optimization helps manage complexity by providing near-optimal solutions quickly.

Dynamic Changes:

- Efficiently adapts to changes with (O(V + E) + O(V*(V + E))) complexity, making the system responsive to updates without complete re-computation.
4.Conclusion

The solution is designed to handle large graphs with reasonable efficiency. The use of heuristics improves practical performance, allowing the system to handle dynamic changes and scale effectively.
